<h3>Project 3 (Easy) - Relatedness Estimator</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
Hi there! You are currently looking at the website for my CS CM124 project. My name (as shown above) is Andrew Kuang and I am a fourth-year student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science. Below, you will find an introduction to the project I have decided to tackle as well as my source code and presentation slides. I will also be tracking my weekly progress throughout this process and providing self-evaluation and planning for the weeks to come.
</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 3em;">
Being an undergraduate, I decided to take on the easy version of project 3, estimating relatedness. For this project, I will be taking the genotypes of two individuals (whom I will know to be related/unrelated; however, my program will not) and testing the accuracy of my algorithm in determining the relatedness. I will also be implementing a baseline method that will naively compare the two genotypes to determine relatedness. After, I will design my own algorithm that will ideally improve on the three benchmarks of speed, accuracy, and memory. More in-depth information can be found in my presentation slides below.
</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

For this project my goals are to:</br>
</br>
1. Come up with a naive, baseline algorithm.</br>
2. Be able to generate data to test on.</br>
3. Come up with an improved algorithm (on three benchmarks: speed, accuracy, memory).</br>
4. Compare the two algorithms on varying SNP sizes and minor allele frequencies (MAF).</br>
5. Improve my own algorithm to see a signifncant increase in performance.</br>
6. Understand the relationship between SNP sizes, mafs, and false positives.</br>

<h1> Weekly Progress Reports </h1>

<hr>
<h3>Week 5: April 27, 2015 ~ May 3, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- After thinking it over, I have chosen to go with Project 3, the relatedness estimator. </br>
- Learned how to create a webpage on Github to host my project wiki.</br>

<h4>Issues</h4>

- No issues, as I haven't started the actual project, but I need to understand the project first.

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Read up on relatedness; understand the computational problem.</br>
- Come up with a baseline algorithm.</br>

<h3>Week 6: May 4, 2015 ~ May 10, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- Attempted to come up with baseline algorithm, very simple.</br>
	> compare two individuals's genotypes SNP by SNP, it > 50% of matches -> assume related.</br>
- Need to come up with a way to generate data so that I can test the baseline algorithm.</br>

<h4>Issues</h4>

- No issues yet during the writing of the baseline algorithm code; however, no testing has been done, so results are unconclusive.</br>

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Come up with data generator quickly so that I can begin testing my baseline algorithm.</br>
- Start working on improved algorithm.</br>

<h3>Week 7: May 11, 2015 ~ May 17, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- Successfully created data generator and tested baseline algorithm. Results of algorithm were not bad considering the naivety of the approach.</br>
- Working on improved algorithm; I think I will need to use some sort of probability matrix (based on Bayes' theorem) and look at generations (i.e. parents)</br>

<h4>Issues</h4>

- Had some trouble properly creating the data generator, but all in all in was pretty straightforward. After some testing, everything worked fine.</br>
- Having some trouble coming up with my own algorithm. Still researching various approaches, but some of them seem too mathematically intensive for my purposes. </br>
- Busy with school, not much time to work on the project. Need to pick up speed to finish before presentation time.</br>

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Do more research on the various methods and choose one.</br>
- Implement said method.</br>
- Test against baseline algorithm and compare results.</br>

<h3>Week 8: May 18, 2015 ~ May 24, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- Finally had more time to work on the project this week, was able to finish an elementary version of my final algorithm. Performs slightly better than the baseline algorithm.

<h4>Issues</h4>

- Few issues sorting things out to come up with my current algorithm, but still needs improvement. Will probably spend a lot of time next week to complete the algorithm, run my tests, and make my presentation.

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Improve algorithm further. Try some new tweaks and maybe double-check probability matrices to ensure everything is calculated correctly. Check for any optimziations.</br>
- Once satisfied with algorithm, begin testing it against the baseline and start gathering data for presentation.</br>
- Make presentation.</br>

<h3>Week 9: May 25, 2015 ~ May 31, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- Algorithm is at a satisfactory performance level (accuracy and memory). Maybe need clean up algorithm with comments and proper formatting.</br>
- Was supposed to present this week Friday, but was pushed to next week. As such, I had already finished the presentation, but may go back to make some improvements.</br>

<h4>Issues</h4>

- No large problems; found some optimization errors in my code and fixed those. </br>
- Running the tests on the two algorithms made me realize a few errors in my computations and, fixing those, allowed me to complete my algorithm.</br>

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Pretty much done with everything. Fix presentation and code?</br>

<h3>Week 10: June 1, 2015 ~ June 7, 2015</h3>
<h4>Progress Report</h4>

- Made some minor changes to formatting both in the code and presentation.</br>
- Finally presented.</br>

<h4>Issues</h4>

- None.

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

- Still need to show Dat my code.</br>
- Study for the final.</br>
