<h3>Project 3 (Easy) - Relatedness Estimator</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
Hi there! You are currently looking at the website for my CS CM124 project. My name (as shown above) is Andrew Kuang and I am a fourth-year student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science. Below, you will find an introduction to the project I have decided to tackle as well as my source code and presentation slides. I will also be tracking my weekly progress throughout this process and providing self-evaluation and planning for the weeks to come.

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Being an undergraduate, I decided to take on the easy version of project 3, estimating relatedness. For this project, I will be taking the genotypes of two individuals (whom I will know to be related/unrelated; however, my program will not) and testing the accuracy of my algorithm in determining the relatedness. I will also be implementing a baseline method that will naively compare the two genotypes to determine relatedness. After, I will design my own algorithm that will ideally improve on the three benchmarks of speed, accuracy, and memory. More in-depth information can be found in my presentation slides below.
